In this lab, you will clone the GitHub repository
for this course within your AI platform
notebook instance and save it on your project. Then, you can work with a notebook to try
out the ML APIs. As before, the labs often have you simply run through
a worked out example. We're choosing to do
it this way because unfortunately we can't help you personally debug your code. To make sure you understand
what is being done though, try changing the code
and see if you understand the impact
of those changes. Alternatively, remove the code from a critical section
of the notebook. The critical sections
are often pointed out in the challenge
sections of the labs, and see if you can write
the code yourself. If you get stuck, look
back at the solution.
