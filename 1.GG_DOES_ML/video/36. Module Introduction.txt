Let's now talk about the development
environment you will use in this specialization. We're going to be talking about Python notebooks in the Cloud. AI Platform Notebooks are the integrated development
environment you'll be using to write your code
in this course. AI Platform Notebooks
run on virtual machines. Because of that, we'll talk about Compute Engine and Cloud Storage. Why? Two things follow from the fact that AI Platform
Notebooks run on a VM. First, it means that you can
actually control and change what sort of machine is running your notebook by for example, giving it more memory
or adding a GPU without having to rewrite
your notebook from scratch. Second, VMs are ephemeral. Consequently, anything
that you want to persist you must
store outside the VM. The best place to do that, especially for large binary
files is in Cloud Storage. So after reviewing how
Compute Engine works, we'll review the basics
of Cloud Storage. The notebooks themselves
will store to Cloud repository so that
they're under revision control. Finally, you'll do
a lab so you can get hands-on with
AI Platform Notebooks. You'll see how to use
AI Platform Notebooks together with BigQuery, which is a managed data
analysis service on a cloud, that you'll use to execute
ad hoc queries at scales and speeds that are possible with traditional
database systems. Then, you'll look at how to
invoke pre-trained ML models, and do this from within
AI Platform Notebooks. We'll learn how to
develop Machine Learning models and Python notebooks, with a notebook server
is in the cloud and execute ad hoc queries using
serverless technologies. Not every Machine Learning model needs to be built from scratch. Also in this module, my colleague Sarah
will show you how to invoke pre-trained
Machine Learning models.
