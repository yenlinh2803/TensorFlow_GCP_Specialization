AI Platform Notebooks are a fully hosted version of the popular JupyterLab notebook environment. This has replaced Cloud Datalab as the default notebook environment for Google Cloud Platform. You can treat mentions of Datalab and AI Platform Notebooks interchangeably in this course and the rest of the courses in this specialization.

AI Platform (formerly known as Cloud ML Engine) makes it easy for machine learning developers, data scientists, and data engineers to take their ML projects from ideation to production and deployment, quickly and cost-effectively. From data engineering to “no lock-in” flexibility, AI Platform’s integrated tool chain helps you build and run your own machine learning applications.
