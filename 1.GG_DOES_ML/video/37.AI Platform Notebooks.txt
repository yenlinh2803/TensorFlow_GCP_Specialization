Do you use IPython or Jupyter
notebooks today? Increasingly, data scientists work in self-descriptive,
shareable, and executable notebooks whenever they want to do data analysis,
or machine learning. This is what the interface
of Jupyter lab looks like. Notice how there
are codes such as interleave with
markup and output. This interleaving is what makes this style of
computing so useful. Data analysis and
machine learning are commonly carried out in
notebooks like this. The code is in the blue section, you can execute the code by either clicking
the Run button, or by pressing Shift plus Enter. The red section displays
output from the command. Notice that the output here isn't just command line output, it's charts and tables as well. The yellow section
contains markup, so you can explain
why you're doing, what you're doing in plain text. You can export the notebook
as a stand alone file. You can also commit
your changes into a code repository in GCP. The lab will show you how to pull from and commit to
code repositories.
